	<h3>About</h3>

	<p>
		In the Spring of 2017 a campus group contacted the club and asked if any of our members were interested in working on a video game for a social media campaign contest they were participating in.
		Two of our members joined up with them and created a visual novel based on a script the group gave them. 
		The game was supposed to educate its users about identifying potential signs that their friends/family were in danger of joining a terrorist organization, or committing a terrorist attack.
		It also would show the users how they should try and stop their family members from joining terrorist organizations by criticizing their families philosophy or reporting them to the authorities at the correct time.
		The game went on to be featured on local news and helped the campus group win their social media competition beaitng 50+ schools nationwide!

	<h3>Development</h3>
	<p>The game was made over the course of two months in the GameMaker engine. One member made all of the art while the other handled the programming and writing some of the script. 
	   Both members were pressed for time due to the deadline for the project but managed to eek out a game anyway.
	   This project is a good example of how being in the club can help you learn how to quickly acquire game dev skills and work under time pressure.
