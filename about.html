   <h1>About</h1>

   <h1>Club Games and Projects</h1>
   <p>
   This website also hosts numerous completed and playable <a href="games.html">Games</a> the club has made, and has information about ongoing and past student group <a href="project.html">Projects.</a>
   This semester will be the club's first large scale group project, where students will create a mario party style local multiplayer video board game and demo it at an event at the end of the semester.
   If you are interested in contributing to that project head over to the <a href = "projects/groupgame2018.html">Project Page</a> and take a look at the framework and tutorials posted there to start making minigames.
   </p>
  
  
     <h1>Events</h1>
  
     We host numerous game dev related events like game jams and workshops, and provide game dev <a href="resources.html">resources</a> for students to use.
     We host at least one 24+ hour game jam per semester, numerous smaller 2-6 hour "game dashes", and hold weekly meetings, workshops, and labs.
     Dates of these events are on our calendar on the <a href = >Events page</a>
  
     <h3>Game Jams and Dashes</h3>
     
     If you are unfamiliar with what a game jam is, it is essentially a hackathon but focused on making a playable game.
     A theme is announced at the beginning of the event and then participants have 24 - 48 hours to make a playable prototype of a game that fits the theme.
     Game jams are an fun and useful way to learn about game dev and game design and forces you to sit down and plan out and implement a simple project.
     Game dashes are just game jams but on a smaller scale, allowing members who cant commit to lengthy game jams to have the game jam experience as well.
     Completed games from game jams will be hosted in the <a href = "games.html#gamejam">game jam</a> section of our Games page.
    <h3>Weekly Meeting</h3>
    <p>
      We hold a meeting every week on Thursday in CSIC TBD.
      The first 10-20 minutes of each meeting are dedicated to showing game demos and talking about industry news.
      The rest of the meeting will be a group discussion/activity about our club projects or a directed discussion/presentation about some game design concept or game dev tool.
      These meeting are often very low key and casual and are more social gathering that give members a chance to hang out and talk about game dev stuff.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Labs and Workshops</h3>
    <p>
    Officers of the club will host labs and workshops dedicated to teaching and developing game dev skills.
    Workshops are themed events where one Officer presents and gives a tutorial that shows members how to use a particular game dev tool or concept, and then walks them through how to actually implement it in a sample project.
    Workshops will be similar to Computer Science discussions where the officer acts as a TA. Workshops are hosted once every week or two and will be on the event calender and announced at meetings and on the facebook page.
    Labs are more similar to Computer Science office hours, the club reserves a room and officers will be in the room, working on their porjects or homework, and will be available to give advice or help other members with their games.
